Brief Project Description:
We plan on making a 2D, simplified version of the high paced cooking game, Overcooked. In this game, we want to make it so that the player is able to control a chef that can perform various tasks and prepare dishes to be submitted for points. After a set amount of time, the player is rated on the amount of dishes prepared and the efficiency in which they did so.
